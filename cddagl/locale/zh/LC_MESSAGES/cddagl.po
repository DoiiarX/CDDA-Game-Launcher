"\n"
"### Where is my previous version?\n"
"\n"
"Is it stored in the `previous_version` directory inside your game "
"directory.\n"
"\n"
"### How does the launcher update my game?\n"
"\n"
"* The launcher downloads the archive for the new version.\n"
"* If the `previous_version` subdirectory exists, the launcher moves it in"
" the recycle bin.\n"
"* The launcher moves everything from the game directory in the "
"`previous_version` subdirectory.\n"
"* The launcher extracts the downloaded archive in the game directory.\n"
"* The launcher inspect what is in the `previous_version` directory and it"
" copies the saves, the mods, the tilesets, the soundpacks and a bunch of "
"others useful files from the `previous_version` directory that are "
"missing from the downloaded archive to the real game directory. It will "
"assume that mods that are included in the downloaded archive are the "
"newest and latest version and it will keep those by comparing their "
"unique ident value.\n"
"\n"
"### I think the launcher just deleted my files. What can I do?\n"
"\n"
"The launcher goes to great lengths not to delete any file that could be "
"important to you. With the default and recommended settings, the launcher"
" will always move files instead of deleting them. If you think you lost "
"files during an update, check out the `previous_version` subdirectory. "
"That is where you should be able to find your previous game version. You "
"can also check for files in your recycle bin. Those are the main 2 places"
" where files are moved and where you should be able to find them.\n"
"\n"
"### My antivirus product detected the launcher as a threat. What can I "
"do?\n"
"\n"
"Poor antivirus products are known to detect the launcher as a threat and "
"block its execution or delete the launcher. A simple workaround is to add"
" the launcher binary in your antivirus whitelist or select the action to "
"trust this binary when detected.\n"
"\n"
"If you are paranoid, you can always inspect the source code yourself and "
"build the launcher from the source code. You are still likely to get "
"false positives. There is little productive efforts we can do as software"
" developers with these. We have [a nice building "
"guide](https://github.com/DazedNConfused-/CDDA-Game-"
"Launcher/blob/master/BUILDING.md) for those who want to build the "
"launcher from the source code.\n"
"\n"
"Many people are dying to know why antivirus products are identifying the "
"launcher as a threat. There has been many wild speculations to try to "
"pinpoint the root cause for this. The best way to find out would be to "
"ask those antivirus product developers. Unfortunatly, they are unlikely "
"to respond for many good reasons. We could also speculate on this for "
"days on end. Our current best speculation is because we use a component "
"called PyInstaller [that is commonly flagged as a "
"threat](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/4633). Now, if "
"you want see how deep the rabbit hole goes, you can keep on searching or "
"speculating on why PyInstaller itself is commonly flagged as a threat. "
"This research is left as an exercise to the reader.\n"
"\n"
"Many people are also asking why not simply report the launcher as a false"
" positive to those antivirus products. We welcome anyone who wants to "
"take the time to do it, but we believe it is mostly unproductive. Those "
"processes are often time-consuming and ignored. Someone would also have "
"to do them all over again each time we make a new release or when one of "
"the component we use is updated or changed. The current state of threat "
"detection on PC is quite messy and sad especially for everyone using "
"*free* antivirus products.\n"
"\n"
"### I found an issue with the game itself or I would like to make a "
"suggestion for the game itself. What should I do?\n"
"\n"
"You should [contact the game developpers](https://cataclysmdda.org/#ive-"
"found-a-bug--i-would-like-to-make-a-suggestion-what-should-i-do) about "
"this. We are mainly providing a tool to help with the game. We cannot "
"provide support for the game itself.\n"
"\n"
"### How do I update to a new version of the game launcher?\n"
"\n"
"The launcher will automatically check for updated version on start. If it"
" finds one, the launcher will prompt you to update. You can always "
"download [the latest version on github](https://github.com/DazedNConfused"
"-/CDDA-Game-Launcher/releases). Those using the portable version will "
"have to manually download and manually update the launcher. From the help"
" menu, you can also check for new updates.\n"
"\n"
"### The launcher keeps crashing when I start it. What can I do?\n"
"\n"
"You might need to delete your configs file to work around this issue. "
"That filename is `configs.db` and it is located in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\CDDA "
"Game Launcher\\`. Some users have reported and encountered unrelated "
"starting issues. In some cases, running a debug version of the launcher "
"to get more logs might help to locate the issue. [Creating an issue about"
" this](https://github.com/DazedNConfused-/CDDA-Game-Launcher/issues) is "
"probably the way to go.\n"
"\n"
"### I just installed the game and it already has a big list of mods. Is "
"there something wrong?\n"
"\n"
"The base game is bundled with a good number of mods. You can view them "
"more like modules that you can activate or ignore when creating a new "
"world in game. These mods or modules can provide a different game "
"experience by adding new items, buildings, mobs, by disabling some game "
"mechanics or by changing how you play the game. They are a simple way of "
"having a distinctive playthrough using the same game engine. The game is "
"quite enjoyable without any of these additional mods or by using the "
"default mods when creating a new world. You should probably avoid using "
"additional mods if you are new to the game for your first playthrough to "
"get familiar with the game mechanics. Once you are comfortable, after one"
" or a few playthroughs, I suggest you check back the base game mods or "
"even some external mods for your next world.\n"
"\n"
"### A mod in the repository is broken or is crashing my game when "
"enabled. What can I do? ###\n"
"\n"
"It is frequent for game updates to break mods especially on the "
"experimental branch. You could try to see if there is an update for that "
"mod. You could try updating that mod by removing it and installing it "
"again. You could try to contact the mod author and ask him to update his "
"mod.\n"
"\n"
"Maintaining external mods can be a difficult task for an ever expanding "
"and changing base game. The only sure and *official* way to have good "
"working mods is to have them included in the base game. If you are "
"concerned about having a reliable gaming experience, you should consider "
"using the base game mods exclusivly and you should consider using the "
"stable branch.\n"
"\n"
"If you find out a mod in the repository is clearly abandonned and not "
"working anymore, please [open an issue](https://github.com/DazedNConfused"
"-/CDDA-Game-Launcher/issues) about it so it can be removed.\n"
"\n"
"### Will you make a Linux or macOS version?\n"
"\n"
"Most likely not. You can check [the linux "
"issue](https://github.com/DazedNConfused-/CDDA-Game-Launcher/issues/329) "
"and [the mac issue](https://github.com/DazedNConfused-/CDDA-Game-"
"Launcher/issues/73) for more information.\n"
"\n"
"### It does not work? Can you help me?\n"
"\n"
"Submit your issues [on Github](https://github.com/DazedNConfused-/CDDA-"

"### 我的上一个版本在哪里？\n"

"### 启动器如何更新我的游戏？\n"
"\n"
"* 启动器会下载新版本的存档。\n"
"* 如果存在 `previous_version` 子目录，启动器会将其移到回收站。\n"
"* 启动器会将游戏目录中的所有内容移到 `previous_version` 子目录中。\n"
"* 启动器会在游戏目录中提取下载的存档。\n"
"* 启动器会检查 `previous_version` 目录中的内容，并从中复制保存、模组、贴图包、音效包和其他有用的文件到实际游戏目录中。它会假设包含在下载存档中的模组是最新版本，并通过比较它们的唯一标识值来保留它们。\n"
"\n"
"### 我认为启动器刚刚删除了我的文件。我该怎么办？\n"
"\n"
"启动器会竭尽全力不删除任何对您重要的文件。在默认和推荐的设置下，启动器将始终将文件移动而不是删除它们。如果您认为在更新过程中丢失了文件，请查看 `previous_version` 子目录。那里应该能找到您的先前游戏版本。您还可以在回收站中查找文件。这是文件被移动和您应该能够找到它们的主要两个地方。\n"
"\n"
"### 我的杀毒软件检测到启动器为威胁。我该怎么办？\n"
"\n"
"不幸的是，一些杀毒软件产品已知会检测到启动器为威胁并阻止其执行或删除启动器。一个简单的解决方法是将启动器二进制文件添加到您的杀毒软件白名单中，或者在检测到时选择信任此二进制文件的操作。\n"
"\n"
"如果您很担心，您始终可以自己检查源代码并从源代码构建启动器。但仍然可能会出现误报。我们作为软件开发者在这方面可以做的事情很少。对于那些想要从源代码构建启动器的人，我们有一个[详细的构建指南](https://github.com/DazedNConfused-/CDDA-Game-Launcher/blob/master/BUILDING.md)。\n"
"\n"
"许多人都渴望知道为什么杀毒软件产品会将启动器标识为威胁。有很多猜测试图找出根本原因。找出原因的最佳方法是向那些杀毒软件产品的开发人员提问。不幸的是，出于许多正当原因，他们不太可能回应。我们也可以无休止地猜测这个问题。我们目前的最佳猜测是因为我们使用了一个称为 PyInstaller 的组件，[通常被标记为威胁](https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/issues/4633)。现在，如果您想了解这个问题的深层次原因，您可以继续搜索或猜测为什么 PyInstaller 本身通常被标记为威胁。这项研究留给读者自己去完成。\n"
"\n"
"许多人也在问，为什么不简单地向那些杀毒软件产品报告启动器是误报呢？我们欢迎任何愿意花时间做这件事的人，但我们认为这在大多数情况下是不太有益的。这些过程通常耗时且被忽视。而且每当我们发布新版本或更改我们使用的组件之一时，都需要再次执行这些过程。目前，PC 上的威胁检测状态相当混乱和令人沮丧，尤其是对于使用*免费*杀毒软件产品的用户来说。\n"
"\n"
"### 我发现游戏本身存在问题，或者我想对游戏本身提出建议。我该怎么办？\n"
"\n"
"您应该[联系游戏开发人员](https://cataclysmdda.org/#ive-found-a-bug--i-would-like-to-make-a-suggestion-what-should-i-do)。我们主要提供了一个工具来帮助您玩游戏。我们不能为游戏本身提供支持。\n"
"\n"
"### 如何更新游戏启动器到新版本？\n"
"\n"
"启动器将在启动时自动检查更新版本。如果找到新版本，启动器将提示您进行更新。您还可以在[GitHub 上下载最新版本](https://github.com/DazedNConfused-/CDDA-Game-Launcher/releases)。使用便携版的用户将需要手动下载和手动更新启动器。在帮助菜单中，您还可以检查新的更新。\n"
"\n"
"### 启动器在启动时不断崩溃。我该怎么办？\n"
"\n"
"您可能需要删除您的配置文件以解决此问题。该文件名为 `configs.db`，位于 `%LOCALAPPDATA%\\CDDA Game Launcher\\` 中。一些用户报告并遇到了与启动无关的启动问题。在某些情况下，运行启动器的调试版本以获取更多日志可能有助于查找问题。[创建关于此问题的问题](https://github.com/DazedNConfused-/CDDA-Game-Launcher/issues)可能是解决问题的方法。\n"
"\n"
"### 我刚刚安装游戏，但已经有很多模组的列表。这是有问题吗？\n"

"基础游戏捆绑了许多模组。您可以将它们视为在游戏中创建新世界时可以激活或忽略的模块。这些模组或模块可以通过添加新物品、建筑、生物、禁用某些游戏机制或更改游戏玩法来提供不同的游戏体验。它们是在相同的游戏引擎下进行不同游戏的简单方式。即使没有这些附加模组，或者在创建新世界时使用默认模组，游戏仍然非常有趣。如果您是第一次玩游戏，建议您在第一次游戏中熟悉游戏机制时避免使用额外的模组。一旦您感到舒适，经过一次或多次游戏后，我建议您再次查看基础游戏模组或甚至一些外部模组，以进行下一次游戏。\n"
"\n"
"### 存储库中的模组损坏或在启用时导致我的游戏崩溃。我该怎么办？ ###\n"
"\n"
"游戏更新经常会破坏模组，尤其是在实验分支上。您可以尝试查看是否有该模组的更新。您可以尝试通过删除并重新安装该模组来更新该模组。您还可以尝试联系模组的作者并要求他更新模组。\n"
"\n"
"维护外部模组对于一个不断扩大和变化的基础游戏来说可能是一项困难的任务。唯一确定且*官方*保持模组正常工作的方法是将其包含在基础游戏中。如果您担心游戏体验的可靠性，您应该考虑专门使用基础游戏模组，并考虑使用稳定分支。\n"
"\n"
"如果您发现存储库中的模组明显被弃用且不再工作，请[提出问题](https://github.com/DazedNConfused-/CDDA-Game-Launcher/issues)以进行删除。\n"
"\n"
"### 您会制作Linux或macOS版本吗？\n"
"\n"
"很可能不会。您可以查看[Linux问题](https://github.com/DazedNConfused-/CDDA-Game-Launcher/issues/329)和[Mac问题](https://github.com/DazedNConfused-/CDDA-Game-Launcher/issues/73)以获取更多信息。\n"
"\n"
"### 它无法工作？您能帮助我吗？\n"
"\n"
"请在[GitHub上提交您的问题](https://github.com/DazedNConfused-/CDDA-Game-Launcher/issues)。尽量[有效报告错误](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html)。"
